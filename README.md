# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Building an code quiz

# Description - Why did build an employee management?

The main purpose to build this is to create a timed coding quiz by using Javascript fundementals. The user will be given with the quiz rules and a start button when they first launch the app. The start button starts a 75-second countdown and displays a list of multiple-choice questions that changes as the user clicks. If the user chooses the wrong answer then they will be penalised by getting their time deducted by 15-seconds.

# What does this project do? and how?


The goal of this project is to practise fundamental development skills like accessing the DOM, adding event listeners, and setting up and accessing local storage, among others. These abilities are required to construct a website that reacts dynamically to user inputs.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
